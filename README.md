# ItalianGeolocations

ItalianGeolocations is an API server offering Italian cities' geolocations
  
  * It is made with Elixir, Phoenix and ETS as in-memory database
  * This project is in early alpha development stage
  * It's more a kind of playground to teach myself some Elixir (for great good!) than a real thing
  * Warning: some coordinates are clearly wrong! Will be fixed as soon as I get them all correct
  * The lookup in the ETS table is whole-word and case sensitive
